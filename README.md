# California Law Enforcement Agencies
This is a list of California law enforcement agencies that we have gathered and curated for the purpose of finding and tracking policy manuals and military equipment inventories. Each row represents a law enforcement agency.

## Methodology
This list is based on the [California's Commision on Police Officer Standards and Training](https://post.ca.gov/le-agencies). Some LEAs on that list do not appear on this list because our primary interest is in identifying the policy manuals. Some LEAs, particularly community college police departments, are part of a shared resource and use the same policy.
